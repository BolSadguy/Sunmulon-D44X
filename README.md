1 PCB per button, each PCB uses 3 of each of the above items (can use 2 if you never plan to use the NC terminal)

Use M3 screws (15mm) and nuts for securing PCB and switch to button. Thumb screws or thumb nuts will make changing things easier but beware of the internal space they take up and how your buttons will be clumped together in an arcade layout.

PCBs are compatible with both 24mm and 30mm Sunmulons, though generally they must be installed after the buttons have been mounted.

This revision of the PCBs is untested, though the changes between this one and the batch I used for testing are minor.
